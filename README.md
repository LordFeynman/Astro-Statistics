Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Q1) What is the probability to win switching door, knowing that the host knows where it is the price and open always the door with a goat?
Q2) What is the probability to win switching door, knowing that the host choose randomly which door to open?
Q3) What is the probability to win switching door, knowing that the host choose sometimes randomly and sometimes only goats, which door to open?
Q4) Can you devise a simulation to test your answers for questions Q1, Q2 and Q3?
