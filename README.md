# Astro-Statistics and Cosmology Assignments
This is a repository for the Astrostatistics assignments for the Master's Degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology of the University of Padua.
## Assignment 1

"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

**(Q1)** What is the probability to win switching door, knowing that the host knows where it is the price and open always the door with a goat?

**(Q2)** What is the probability to win switching door, knowing that the host choose randomly which door to open?

**(Q3)** What is the probability to win switching door, knowing that the host choose sometimes randomly and sometimes only goats, which door to open?

**(Q4)** Can you devise a simulation to test your answers for questions Q1, Q2 and Q3?"

## Assignment 2

"If $N$ independent random variables $x_1; x_2; \dotsi ; x_N$ have means $\mu_n$ and finite variances $\sigma_n^2$, then, if the limit of large $N$, the sum $\sum_n x_n$ has a distribution that tends to a normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean $\sum_n \mu_n$ and variance $\sum_n \sigma_n^2$. Now, consider the following questions.

**(Q1)** Two ordinary dice with faces labelled $1, \dotso , 6$ are thrown. What is the probability distribution of the sum of the values? What is the probability distribution of the absolute difference between the values?

**(Q2)** One hundred ordinary dice are thrown. What, roughly, is the probability distribution of the sum of the values? Sketch the probability distribution and estimate its mean and standard deviation.

**(Q3)** How can two cubical dice be labelled using the numbers $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ so that when the two dice are thrown the sum has a uniform probability distribution over the integers 1-12? Plot the pdf.

**(Q4)** Is there any way that one hundred dice could be labelled with integers such that the probability distribution of the sum is uniform?

**(Q5)** Can you plot the probability distribution function for the cases in Q1 when the number of dice is $N > 2$? When $N = 2, 3, 4, 10, 20$ looks like a gaussian pdf? If not, why?

**(Q6)** Can you plot the probability distribution function for the cases in Q4 when the number of dice is $N > 2$? When $N = 2, 3, 4, 10, 20$ looks like a gaussian pdf? If not, why?"
